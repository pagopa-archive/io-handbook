## 👨🏻‍🏫 Program Management

### Hubspot

1. We use Hubspot CRM to keep track of of the onboarding process of Public Administrations and partners to IO.
1. As soon as you get in touch with a Public Administration or partner that wants to join IO, create a _Company_ and a _Deal_ on Hubspot.
1. We identify organizations (i.e. Public Administrations, system integrators, technology aggregators, etc...) as _Companies_ in Hubspot.
1. We identify integration opportunities (i.e. specific servicies, departments, etc...) as _Deals_ in Hubspot.
1. Each _Deal_ (opportunity) is associated to a _stage_ in [the Onboarding Pipeline](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/5461487/deals/board/view/all/).
1. The _Onboarding Pipeline_ is composed of a sequence of stages, each describing the stage of the opportunity, from a less mature (i.e. first contact) to a more mature (i.e. contract signed, integration reaching production) state.
1. Note that each organization may have more than one _Deal_ going on at the same time, this is normal as different integration opportunities may be handled by different departments and may have different stages of maturity (e.g. an integration project for a service is almost ready for production while we start discussing with a different department about a different service).
1. Make sure to update the stage of each _Deal_ you're responsible, it's important to have an up to date view of all the different opportunities we're working on.
1. Remember to create a _Contact_ for each person you get in contact with in the organization (Hubspot provides [plugins to do this automatically for you](https://app.hubspot.com/sales-products-settings/5461487/email/extension)).
1. Each time you exchange emails with the contacts, remember to add the [Hubspot BCC address](https://app.hubspot.com/sales-products-settings/5461487/bcc) or forward the email to the [Hubspot forwarding address](https://app.hubspot.com/sales-products-settings/5461487/bcc) - this will make sure all email are logged in the CRM and anybody taking over the contact will have access to the communication trail.
1. Each time you do a conf call with an organization or a specific contact, make sure to [log the call](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/contacts/manually-log-a-call-email-or-meeting-on-a-record) and write a short report describing the outcome and any action points that emerged.
